## Introduction

This project implements a classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Players can compete against each other on a 3x3 grid directly in the browser. The game includes features such as move validation, win condition detection, and the ability to restart the game after it concludes.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can take turns clicking on the grid to place their moves ('X' or 'O').
- **Win Condition Detection:** Automatically detects when a player wins by achieving three symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- **Move Validation:** Ensures that players cannot override each other's moves or make invalid moves.
- **Game Restart:** Allows players to start a new game after the current one ends.
